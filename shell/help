•	-r FILE: FILE exists and the read permission is granted
•	-w FILE: FILE exists and the write permission is granted
•	-x FILE: FILE exists and the execute permission is granted
• -z : string is null (has zero length)
•	if [ ! -f "${1}" ] || [ ! -r "${1}" ] - File ${1} does not exists or not readable
